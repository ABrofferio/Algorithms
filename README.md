Algorithms
Teaching myself ruby while working on algorithm challenges I find online.

SpiralMatrix:
Given a matrix of m x n elements (m rows, n columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

Remove First Minimum:
Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value without mutating the original array. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.
